### Judging
All eligible entrants will have their work reviewed in a preliminary judging round conducted by the Sports Info Solutions Research & Development Department. Each submission will be judged by the evaluation criteria below. Three finalists will be selected to advance to the final judging round. Finalists must be available to participate in the live judging round on August 4, 2021 via a live Zoom call.
 
### Evaluation Criteria
This competition is being held with two separate tracks: a General Track that emphasizes evaluating football as a whole, and a Gaming Track that focuses on edges that can be gained in fantasy and/or betting contexts. Participants are welcome to submit entries to both tracks, provided that they do not make more than one final submission on a given track.


#### General Track Prompt
Which route combinations were most popular in the NFL in 2020? Of these route combinations, which perform best against each coverage type?
 
#### Gaming Track Prompt
How much of an effect should quarterbacks and wide receivers have on a point spread? Responses must provide estimates for Patrick Mahomes and Julio Jones and also include other prominent players from the 2020 season as examples.

You will submit the answers to these questions in the form of a presentation (e.g. PowerPoint or Google Slides, R Markdown), providing any additional information about the analysis that led you to your conclusions. The document provided should include, but is not limited to, the items below. Their weight in the grading process is also included.

• Final answers (15%) — The answers to the above question(s), enumerated explicitly so they are easy to identify. While there isn’t going to be a “right” answer to any of these questions, it is crucial that: a) you provide clear and concise answers to the question(s), and b) the answer(s) you give are based on results found over the course of this project. 

• Assumptions (10%) — The prompts are intentionally a little bit broad so that participants have a chance to work through things in different ways. If appropriate, make sure to clarify any assumptions you might be making about information that wasn’t specified as part of the prompt, and explain why you settled on those assumptions. 
For example: How are you defining the different route combinations you’re considering?

• Evaluation Method (50%) — What methods did you employ to answer the question of interest? This includes any analytical techniques used, but also will take into account the quality of the thought process while evaluating the question(s). 

• Limitations and Future Analysis (10%) — We only provided you a slice of data to work with, and besides, no analysis is complete and final. What additional analysis might you have performed to answer the prompt(s) if you had more expansive resources, and what resources would those be?

• Presentation / Clarity of Communication (15%) — In any research context, it’s critical to be able to communicate the results of an analysis clearly and concisely. Convey the answers to the above question(s) as well as your methods in a clear and direct way that engages the audience.

• Other Data Sources — We are in a golden age of football analytics. Feel free to use other free, publicly available resources to aid in your analysis. You must provide details on any resources that you used outside the provided data, and it must be clear from your discussion what that data was used for. Of course, this competition is centered around the data provided, so don’t lean too heavily on other resources for your key conclusions.
 
### Notification
The finalists will be notified of their progress via email by July 30th, 2021. If a finalist does not respond to the notification attempt within three (3) days from the first notification attempt, then an alternate finalist will be selected from among the eligible entrant pool.

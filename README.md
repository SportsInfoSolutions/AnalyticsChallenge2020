### Submission due date

### Judging
All eligible entrants will have their work reviewed in a preliminary judging round conducted by the Sports Info Solutions Research & Development Department. Each submission will be judged by the evaluation criteria below. Three finalists will be selected to advance to the final judging round. Finalists must be available to participate in the live judging round on July 29, 2020 and must have the means available to participate in a live Zoom call.
 
### Evaluation Criteria
Your task is to answer the following three questions using the data provided as a basis for your conclusions.

1.	Which is the most valuable defensive line position? You can define the positions however you like.
2.	What is the nature of the distribution of talent between the defensive line positions, as you define them?
3.	Not all situations are created equal. In which in-game or roster construction scenarios would the answer to Question 1 change?

You will submit the answers to these questions in the form of a presentation (e.g. PowerPoint or Google Slides), providing any additional information about the analysis that led you to your conclusions. The document provided should include, but is not limited to, the items below. Their weight in the grading process is also included.

• Final answers (15%) — The answers to each of the above questions, enumerated explicitly so they are easy to identify. While there isn’t going to be a “right” answer to any of these questions, it is crucial that: a) you provide clear and concise answers to the questions, and b) the answers you give are based on results found over the course of this project.

• Assumptions (10%) — The questions we are asking are intentionally a little bit broad so that participants have a chance to work through things in different ways. If appropriate, make sure to clarify any assumptions you might be making about information that wasn’t specified as part of the prompt, and explain why you settled on those assumptions. 
For example: How are you defining the different positions you’re considering? How relevant is defending the pass compared to defending the run?

• Evaluation Method (50%) — What criteria did you use to answer the three questions of interest? For Questions 1 and 2, you must explain the steps you took to come up with metrics that allow you to compare positions. For Question 3, explain how you identified the different scenarios to compare, and any changes in the evaluation metric(s) from Questions 1 and 2.

• Limitations and Future Analysis (10%) — We only provided you a slice of data to work with, and besides, no analysis is complete and final. What additional analysis might you have performed to answer these questions if you had more expansive resources, and what resources would those be?

• Presentation / Clarity of Communication (15%) — In any research context, it’s critical to be able to communicate the results of an analysis clearly and concisely. Convey the answers to the above questions as well as your methods in a clear and direct way that engages the audience.

• Other Data Sources — We are in a golden age of football analytics. Feel free to use other free, publicly available resources to aid in your analysis. You must provide details on any resources that you used outside the provided data, and it must be clear from your discussion what that data was used for. Of course, this competition is centered around the data provided, so don’t lean too heavily on other resources for your key conclusions.
